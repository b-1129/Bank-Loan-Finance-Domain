# Bank Loan Data Analysis

*Project Overview*

This project focuses on the analysis of bank loan data to derive actionable insights. Using Power BI, Excel, and SQL, I have conducted a comprehensive exploration of the dataset to create visually compelling dashboards and a detailed query document. The analysis also integrates domain knowledge and financial terminologies to ensure a deeper understanding of the dataset.

*Key Features*

- Data Visualization:

1) Dashboards created using Power BI and Excel to provide insights into loan approvals, defaults, customer demographics, and more.

2) Visuals include bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and trend lines.

- Data Analysis:

1) SQL queries crafted for in-depth exploration of the dataset.

2) Analytical focus on patterns such as loan approval rates, repayment trends, and customer segmentation.

- Domain Knowledge:

1) Incorporated terminologies and concepts from the finance domain to enrich the analysis.

2) Helps stakeholders understand the context and implications of the results.

*Tools Used*

- Power BI: For dynamic dashboards and visual storytelling.

- Excel: For initial data cleaning and static reporting.

- SQL: For querying and preprocessing the dataset.

*Conclusion*

This project demonstrates a robust analysis of bank loan data by combining visualization, data querying, and financial domain knowledge. It highlights the power of integrating tools like Power BI, Excel, and SQL for actionable insights.
